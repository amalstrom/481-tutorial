In the first section of the tutorial, it details how to use Apple’s VoiceOver feature. It say’s we can also use other voice readers, presumably those in other operating systems. However, we are only ever explicitly told how to activate and use the voice reader in Mac OS.

I would add how to do this in Windows. In Windows 10, this can be done by simultaneously clicking the Windows Key and Enter.
